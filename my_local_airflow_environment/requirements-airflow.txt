# LLM_DeepLearning/my_local_airflow_environment/requirements-airflow.txt
# Dedicated requirements for the Airflow environment

# For app.database.models.Job (pgvector.sqlalchemy)
pgvector==0.4.1

# For app.database.models.Job and utils.db_utils.py
# Airflow 2.9.2 base image uses SQLAlchemy ~1.4. This pin is compatible.
SQLAlchemy>=1.4.46,<2.0

# For utils.embedding_utils.py
sentence-transformers==4.1.0
# Example: Pin to a known good version; adjust as needed.
# sentence-transformers will pull in its required versions of torch, transformers, numpy etc.

# For utils.db_utils.py (pd.to_datetime)
pandas==2.2.3 # Matches version in your original requirements.txt

# If gmpy2 is truly needed by your DAG-executed code or a dependency thereof.
# Your Dockerfile prepares OS libraries for it.
# gmpy2==2.2.1

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# 1. The base `apache/airflow:2.9.2-python3.11` image already includes `psycopg2-binary`.
# 2. This list AVOIDS FastAPI-specific libraries and Pydantic V2, which were the primary
#    suspects for breaking the Airflow CLI.
# 3. If `sentence-transformers` requires specific versions of `torch` or `transformers`
#    that conflict with other minimal needs, pip's resolver should handle it or error out.
#    Check the build log carefully.
